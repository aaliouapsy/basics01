        <h2>Article: Takamaru, The Silent Storm of Sakamoto Days</h2>

        <section>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                In the world of Sakamoto Days, where assassins and ordinary life collide, few characters stand out quite like Takamaru. 
                Though not always in the spotlight, his quiet intensity and unwavering sense of loyalty make him one of the most intriguing figures in the manga.

            <h3>His character</h3>
            <p>
                Takamaru embodies discipline, composure, and lethal precision. 
                Once a top-tier assassin, he has since turned his sharp instincts toward supporting his comrades, often acting as the calm strategist in the chaos of battle. 
                His minimalistic fighting style reflects his personality: efficient, controlled, and deeply tactical.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite his stoic demeanor, moments of subtle emotion reveal a human side: a man shaped by duty, loss, and the blurry line between past violence and present peace.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Takamaru may not shout his intentions or seek the limelight, but every action he takes carries weight. 
                In many ways, he represents the balance between restraint and power, a recurring theme in Sakamoto Days. 
                His quiet presence continues to leave a lasting impact, proving that not all strength needs to be loud.
